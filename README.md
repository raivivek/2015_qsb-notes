# Winter School on Quantitative Systems Biology

Repository containing all the resources, notes and a daily summary log of
activates in Winter School. The Winter School programme is organized by
International Centre for Theoretical Science (ICTS) in association with
International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Italy; with support from
National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore and Indian Institute
of Science, Bangalore.


Keeping a log is healthy because it will help me monitor my progress through the
school and also allow me to recall and review content with much ease later.


Inspired from my previous successful attempt [intern-diary].
