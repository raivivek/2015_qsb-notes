Pre School, Day 1
ICTS Campus, 05 December 2015
11.05 PM
I arrived at Yesvantpur Railway Station at 7.15 in the morning, almost exactly the right time for the train. Having traveled through this station often, I knew my way around finding an auto and traveling to IISc even though the driver struggled with the direction. In less than next 20 minutes, I was having my breakfast at 'Prakruthi' near the ATM gate of Indian Institute of Science.

It felt nice to be back in the calm and soothing environment of IISc. The campus is pretty and I find a mysterious sense of comfort here. It is fun to walk through the shaded streets, littered with yellow and pink flowers falling from the adjacent trees. Probably it is this magic that motivated me to walk all the way from the ATM gate to the Old TIFR Centre where I had to board the shuttle.

After a while, I met Praneet who is also participating in the winter school. We both traveled to the main ICTS campus in the arranged shuttle service. It was fun to meet him and share our ideas of science.

We arrived at ICTS earlier than I had expected. The campus, though under construction, has an interesting design and looks appealing. I left Praneet to attend the class while I came to take my room. After freshening up, I joined the classes for the rest of the day starting from 11.00 AM.

The first set of two classes (one and half hours each) were taken by Mukund Thattai who talked about 'numbers' and 'role of quantification' in biology. He built on general concepts of modelling the rough behavior of a complex system based on crude estimates and then applying those models to more precise experiments to see how better we perform. An elegant example he gave was through the discussion of Berg and Purcell's paper of chemoreception. Overall, the main idea of his lectures were to emphasize the role of theoretical modeling, relevant parameter selection and estimation in reducing a complex network to a simpler interpretable one.

During lunch I met with Shubha (completed her Int. M.Tech from Hyderabad) and a couple of other people.

The second half was taken by Supreet Saini who talked in detail about the molecular processes like Translation and Transcription inside the cell, how they are regulated and how different components of a gene network can be understood through a logic network like behavior. The class was elementary for biologists but possibly confusing and too much informative for physicists and other people, who were actually the majority in the school.

After the class, I came back to room and met Prabhat. He's an IIT Kharagpur alumni (Azad/2010) and had just finished his PhD. We talked about different things that have changed in KGP.

Later we went for a walk around the campus. I then joined Sanjay Lamba (PhD, CUJ), Umesh (PhD, CUJ), Sanjay Saini (Prof., DU) for the dinner and had a biref but engaging discussion about todays class. I met up with Prabhat later and joined with Chakit for an extensive discussion on college environment, research facilities, and science in general. We also had a brief talk with Zahra (PhD, ICTP) who comes from Iran.

Overall, met a lot of interesting people with great flair for science. The school was quite engaging and it was inspiring to see people putting in questions from different perspective (due to their diverse background) for a single topic. I am looking forward to other sessions.
