Pre School, Day 2

ICTS Campus, 06 December 2015

09.10 PM

The major highlights today were continuing lectures of Supreet Saini who
discussed about basic processes of transcription and translation inside the cell
and how they are regulated, and a set of two lectures on ecology and evolution
by Prof. Deepa Agashe.

In the first half, Supreet talked about general mechanism of translational
regulation, quorum sensing (intra-species communication) and inter-species
communication. The topics were well illustrated with suitable and well known
examples from the biology (LuxI-LuxR system*, flagella formation, orthogonal
ribosomes, for example). He finished his set of lectures with a discussion on
isogenic populations and heterogeneity.

The first two lectures were very informative and I learned a lot of new
concepts. I found the following to be most interesting:
- Quorum sensing
- Transcriptional interference
- Orthogonal ribosomes
- Isogeny and heterogeneity in populations
- Inter-species communication


The second set of two lectures were taken by Prof. Deepa Agashe who is
a researcher at National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore. The
lectures were quite detailed and packed with a lot of information (too much to
be absorbed in a single day). The presentation, nevertheless, was very
interesting and several new things came up. For example:
- Genetic drift
- Hardy Weinberg Principle
- Role of population size
- Population dynamics
- Optimal foraging theory
- 'Handicap' principle
- r- versus K- selection
- Growth models in ecology
- Malthusian disasters
- Survivorship curves
- To generalize or specialize
- niche concept

A lot of concepts were brought together, woven in a story like fashion.
Although, I did not absorb all of the concept but key ideas came forward quite
nicely. And oh yes, Deepa also brought an amazing fossil to show in the class.

After the class, I went on to a 10 km cycle ride with Sanjay, Chakit, J.C.


Really looking forward to tomorrow's class which is going to be a bit math
heavy.


* My college's iGEM team worked on this LuxI-LuxR system to create a synthetic
bacteria that can detect food spoilage.
