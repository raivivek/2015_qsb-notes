Winter School QSB 2015, ICTS

19 December, 2015

Finally, today was the last day of the Winter School. As told before, the only
task today was to present our project work to the professors, hold a poster
session and then feel free.

------

The presentation session began at 9.30 AM and we were the third group to be
called upon to present. All of the teams had really interesting ideas, although
it was quite visible that lack of time had presented everyone with very
difficult situation of what to do and what not to. Nevertheless, all groups
tried to venture out in the areas which was least known to all the members with
the intent of learning something new.

Overall, I found the idea of projects to be really worthwhile and something
which should be preserved for coming Winter School sessions as well.

In the afternoon, Prof. Sanjay Jain approached our poster and we described our
ideas in greater detail to him. It was exciting to see his present several
additional ideas and approaches that we could have taken to turn the study into
a more interesting or perhaps a generic problems. Even publishable, if you will.

The poster presentation was the last formal element of the school.

Post presentation we took a break and then left for cycling. After riding for
around 4 km, we visited the beautiful Hesarghatta Lake. It was great experience
to be with all the group members and others before they start leaving.

This note probably concludes the series of logs for the Winter School. My last
note will be a simple acknowledgement and thanks to all the people involved in
the school.
