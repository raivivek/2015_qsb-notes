Winter School QSB 2015, ICTS

18 December, 2015

As mentioned in the program schedule, there were no research talks or teaching
lectures scheduled for today. The groups were supposed to take today as a time
off to discuss and work on their projects before the final presentation
tomorrow.

Although, I was originally in Prabhat's groups, I worked primarily with Pooja's
group on their metabolic network project in order to learn something new. It was
a great company where we sat throughout the day and night writing code,
generating plots and making sense of the data. I, however, yielded much before
the presentation was complete but thankfully Chakit endured to make sure it is
complete for final presentation tomorrow.

In the evening, we took some time off to walk outside the campus and watch dark,
starry skies of a country side. Surprisingly, not many people (those living in
metros since birth) get to witness such beautiful scenes.
