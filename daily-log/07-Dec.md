QSB Winter School 2015, ICTS

(written the next day)


Today was one of the most anticipated days of the pre-school. Today, Sandeep
Krishna talked in brief about gene regulatory networks and how a basic
mathematical modeling approach is adopted for understanding their behavior.
Before this, it has mostly been a Biology primer, hence today's lecture was much
sought after by people who are specially from a biology background. The talk was
stimulating with great discussion and comments session with the audience. The
example he discussed was from a paper he co-authored where the authors try to
understand the role of four different (artificially engineered) gene regulatory
mechanism for *lac* operon gene instead of one that occurs naturally.


The second half of the day was taken by Nagasuma Chandra who mostly talked about
computational tools and techniques to understand Micro Array, RNA Seq and ChiP
Seq data. She touched upon a lot of names and techniques in very brief without
delving into technical details. The second part of her lecture was taken by
a research scholar of her lab. She gave a demonstration of how actually the data
processing, clarification and analysis is performed.


The latter part, though informative, felt a bit monotonic. Overall, it was
a good day.


The main school begins from tomorrow and a few more people are expected to join
the teams. There's also going to be poster presentation session tomorrow.

Looking forward to the real school from tomorrow.


P.S. I spent my entire remaining time trying to fix my laptop which went crazy
during upgrade to Ubuntu 15.10. Had to completely reformat it twice, only to be
back to square zero - Ubuntu 14.04.03. What a shame!
