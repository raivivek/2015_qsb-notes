(11.30 pm + 2 hrs)

There were only two lectures scheduled on Saturday. The first one by Tzachi
Pilpel and second by Suckjoon Jun.

### Tzachi Pilpel

Dr. Pilpel continued to explore processes of regulation at translational level,
something about which very little is known when compared to transcriptional
regulatory networks. In one of this attempts, he tries to establish that tRNA
abundance or tRNAs in general can affect a number of cellular phenomenon. The
question in premise being - *How does translation respond to regulation at
transcriptional level*, *What is the translation demand and supply scenario and
its effect on the cellular processes?*

- For this, he analyzes the tRNA abundance (using the tRA index) across several
types of cancer cells and normal cells. A characteristic and curious pattern is
observed between the two.

- Two clusters are obtained when comparing the tRNA abundance levels in
differentiating cells and cells in senescence.

(Now, as a possible improvement, histone marking pattern is used in place of
tRNA gene copy number)

- Differential codon usage in a cell during cell-cycle and during development.

- A distinct codon usage pattern for autonomous cell processes and
multi-cellularity processes.

These observations along with their conservation across several organisms
suggest that tRNA (or equivalently) codon usage pattern act in a demand-supply
fashion to provide a more *modular* way to regulate a number of high level
cellular activities. 


### Suckjoon Jun

Suckjoon talked about 'mother machine' and his 'adder theory' to explain the
cell size homeostasis.

The idea of 'adder theory' is that irrespective of what size a cell is born
with, it adds a constant amount of volume (lambda) to it. This lambda is
a characteristic of media or the growth nutrients.

Two control parameters are significant (we can know this by doing a pair plot
and finding out the uncorrelated plots from the figure)

1. Size (delta)
2. Growth (lambda)

Both of which in turn control the other parameters like birth size, death size,
cell division time and so on.
