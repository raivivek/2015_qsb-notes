## Economy of protein translation

- Multiple codons for the same amino acid

(Find a case where a genetic sequence (gene) exerts a constraint on the choice
of amino acids and hence the protein. In general, we assume the reverse
condition.)

Wobble base pairing, 'disallowed' tRNAs

- Extensive combinatorial complexity of codons (due to codon bias) to generate
a particular amino acid transcript. But obviously, biology cannot afford such
a vast search space but it does take *advantage* of it.

*Thermus thermophilis* uses almost entirely, codons that end with G and
C instead of A or U. *Homo sapiens* follow same trend for most of the genes.
However, *Plasmodium falciparum* on the other hand has a preference for A and
U type codons.

- Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase: The really 'smart' part. While there are
approximately ~40 'allowed' tRNAs inside a cell at a time, there are only 20
Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. That is, no one to one mapping between the tRNAs and
corresponding synthetase, probably providing an additional point of control or
degree of freedom as these tRNA compete for a shared resource.


### tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI)


- 'translational speed' profiles look random

(How can you detect the real 'speed' of the ribosome locally or genome wide?)

### Why not optimize all codons?

- loss of regulation

**Translation elongation is a highly regulated process, governing**

- Productivity
- Folding
- Costs
- Accuracy: Which codon will be more accurate? Low abundant or high abundant?
- Modifications: Probably when an amino acid emerges, a choice of codon can
influence the speed of ribosome and thus allow more time for the modifications.
