## Post Transcriptional Gene Regulation

(protein-RNA, riboswitches, feedback, autoregulation etc.,)

### Summary
* Regulation can occur at every step leading to the protein expression
* RNA is amazing!
  - Versatile structure and dynamics
* Autoregulation is common
  - Easy to evolve
  - Precise control of expression levels

*trp* operon expression attenuation control. A good example which works because
the process is determined by how fast (or how closely to the polymerase) does
ribosome moves.

In other words, a regulation mechanism can exist by hacking the *rate of
translation* itself.

#### Regulatory RNAs in Bacteria

* CsrA, CsrB
* Sequestering of RNA polymerase (altering sigma factors?)
* mRNA cleavage, degradation
* Transcription termination
* Activation (by removing secondary structures that inhibit translation)

Q: How are sRNA themselves are regulated?

Example:

Regulation in RNA phase  virus. Must do 'traffic control' since it cannot
translate and replicate the same RNA. Uses protein-RNA interactions to control
expression.

Nucleation mechanism in T4 bacteriophage.

### Feedback Regulation

(Ref: Nomura et. al., PNAS, Vol 77, No. 12, pp. 7084-7088, December 1980)

### Riboswitches

(Ref: Ronald R. Breaker, http://www.yale.edu/breaker)

(Ref: Serganov et. al., Cell 152, 17-24 (2013) A decade of Riboswitches)

mRNA regulatory motifs - no protein is involved directly. Instead, it is the
regulatory motif that recognizes an effector molecule.

### Autoregulation

A protein regulates its own level by virtue of its own normal activity. For
example, the expression of IF3 (initiation factor 3) and RF2 (release factor 2)
is auto regulated in a fashion that when their concentration is high, the
expression is low and vice-versa.
