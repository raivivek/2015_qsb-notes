## Regulation of Transcription

### Alternate sigma factors

The usual sigma factor associated with RNAP is called house-keeping sigma
factor. Usually, depending on the type of environment and stress conditions
experienced by a cell, different sigma factors can be used.

For example, creation of flagella.

The diversity or the number of these sigma factors depend a lot on the
environment of the host organism. This is probably because having more sigma
factor allows *finer* control in a complicated environment where things need to
be compartmentalized.
