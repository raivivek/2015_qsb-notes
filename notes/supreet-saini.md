## Regulation of Transcription

### Alternate sigma factors

The usual sigma factor associated with RNAP is called house-keeping sigma
factor. Usually, depending on the type of environment and stress conditions
experienced by a cell, different sigma factors can be used.

For example, creation of flagella.

The diversity or the number of these sigma factors depend a lot on the
environment of the host organism. This is probably because having more sigma
factor allows *finer* control in a complicated environment where things need to
be compartmentalized.

Q. Why transcription must exist? In other words, why advantages does having
a transcriptional layer confer to the cell?

### Topology of genes

* Divergent promoters
When two genes transcribe in opposite direction, topology changes
(positive/negative coiling) due to one polymerase on one gene facilitates the
one on the other gene.

* Convergent promoters
When two promoters transcribe in direction towards each other.

In an extreme example of convergent promoters, *transcriptional interference*[5]
occurs.

```

In these arrangements, it is worthwhile to note the positive supercoiling
a polymerase induces when transcribing a gene. When multiple such polymerases
are acting on genes in aforementioned arrangement, these effects can add up or
relieve each other.


## Regulation of Translation

### Structure of mRNA

Does the mRNA has a sequence structure that promote secondary structure
formation?

### Codon usage

For unclear reasons, organisms tend to prefer one over the other codons for
encoding an amino acid (out of several possible due to codon degeneracy). The
causality of the process, however, is not known.

### Ribosome Binding Site (RBS)

Depending on the sequence composition of the ribosome binding site and sequences
around it, the binding affinity of polymerase will change. Ultimately, affecting
the translation process.

## Hacking the central dogma

DNA to RNA channel is pretty well studied and the process can be easily
regulated by constructing small networks consisting of appropriate genetic
elements. Hacking RNA to Protein channel, however, is a bit difficult.

One strategy to create additional channel between RNA to Protein is to create
*orthogonal ribosomes* (O-ribosomes).[6] These ribosomes have an altered rRNA* and
accordingly an altered complementary RBS*. The native ribosomes won't be able to
interact with he modified machinery and vice versa, allowing us an exclusive and
regulated channel of expression to work with.

# Cell-cell communication

## Quorum sensing

Classic example of [Hawaiin Bobtail
Squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euprymna_scolopesS) and *Vibrio fischeri*
symbiosis, LuxI-LuxR expression system

Q: How accurate is the detection of [I] molecule as a proxy for the number of
similar cells present in the environment? In other words, a model and
quantification of this phenomenon.

In Gram Positive bacteria, the molecules cannot freely diffuse outside the cell
and hence quorum sensing occurs through synthesis of peptides and their
reception through specialized protein receptors.

It is important to note that these characteristic molecules ([I], peptides) are
unique depending on the species.

Quite common theme of quorum sensing is pathogenesis, biofilm formation (a
biofilm may involve members from multiple species as well) etc.,


Q: Inter-species communication?


## Inter-species communication

The auto-inducer II molecule (AI2) is quite common across different species for
inter-species communication. However, a great degree of variation and
specificity is achieved by utilizing the different equilibrium forms of AI2
molecules and its derivatives having one or more other inorganic molecule
(Borate in *Vibrio fischeri* for example).

*Bacillus subutilis* becomes naturally competent under stress conditions. This
allows it to take up external DNA and incorporate it within the genome. The
newly take DNA can provide newer functionality that aid survival in extreme
conditions.

The quorum sensing mechanism is not dynamic *per se*. That is, the concentration
of auto inducer molecule required (which is a proxy for the number of similar
cells present in close environment) quorum results to kick in. So, if one were
to shift a number of cells from one environment to other, the required
concentration is not adjusted dynamically.

For example, say in an environment X, a bacteria requires 10 similar cells to
trigger the effects of quorum sensing. Now if we shift it to another environment
where such growth is difficult to achieve, then the threshold will **not**
adjust to a new value such as 5.
