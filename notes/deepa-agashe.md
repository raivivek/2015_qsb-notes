# The theory of natural selection

- Why do (should) we care?
E.g., Antibiotic resistance, artificial selection, viruses evolution

- Evidence of evolution
  - Direct observation of the evolutionary change
  - Homology (versus convergence)
  - Fossils: modifications over time
  - Biogeographic patterns of species distribution

- Key ingredients for evolution
  - Genetic variation (e.g., heterozygosity)
  - Selection pressure (natural or sexual)
  - Genetic drift
  - Population size (determines relative role of selection and drift)

- How does genetic variation persist?
  - New variation continually introduced (Mutation, Recombination, Migration)
  - Neutral or cryptic (e.g., copy numbers)
  - variable selection
  - hereterozygote advantage
  - frequency-dependent selection

- Quantifying evolution
  - Change in allele frequency
  - Hardy Weinberg principle (describe a population that is not evolving)
  - Assumption of HW equilibrium (no mutation or migration or selection, large
  population size, random mating)
